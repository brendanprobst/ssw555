2. Description: 
This articles explains several short comings of a typical team that uses agile methods. This are not flaws with the agile system, but issues
that typically arise in any team environment. The author explains that many time things like technical debt, not focusing on delivering the right product,
getting distracted with small tasks, and long wait times are just a few things that slow agile teams down. To conclude, the author offers some things that
agile teams should be focusing on, such as focusing on the important work, automating procedures, properly allocating resources and time, and mapping value streams.  
3. Recommend?: Yes, I would recommend this article because it gives the reader a better understanding of ways that agile teams can be slowed down. If you're not aware something
is happening, you can't fix it. So hearing about cannot pitfalls will increase the chances that they will be addressed or avoided in the future.
